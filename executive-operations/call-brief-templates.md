# Meeting Brief Templates

## How to Use This File

Meeting briefs help your executive show up prepared and confident. The format should match:
- Your executive's preferences (detail level, structure, format)
- The type of meeting (1:1s vs. board meetings need different briefs)
- Time available (5-minute brief vs. comprehensive briefing book)

**Customize these templates** to match how your executive likes to consume information.

---

## Important: Perspective Note

**These briefs are written BY the EA FOR the executive TO READ.**

When the brief template says **"you"** or **"your"**, it refers to **the executive** (who will be reading the brief), not the EA creating it.

**Examples:**
- "Your Objectives" = The executive's objectives for the meeting
- "Your Talking Points" = Points for the executive to make
- "Your Role" = What the executive should do in the meeting

The EA creates the brief, but writes it as if speaking directly to the executive.

**Questions to answer when setting up:**
1. What format does your executive prefer? (Bullets vs. paragraphs, length, structure)
2. How much detail do they want? (Brief overview vs. comprehensive analysis)
3. What must be included in every brief? (Attendee background, talking points, decisions needed)
4. How far in advance do they want briefs? (Day before, morning of, week before)
5. Do they have specific preferences? (ADHD-friendly formatting, visual aids, specific sections)

## Customizing These Templates

**Questions to ask yourself:**

1. **Format Preferences:**
   - Does my executive prefer bullets or paragraphs?
   - Do they want brief or comprehensive?
   - Do they like visual formatting (bold, headers) or plain text?

2. **Content Priorities:**
   - What information is most critical for them?
   - Do they want attendee background front and center?
   - Do they prefer talking points or open-ended context?

3. **Preparation Style:**
   - Do they read briefs the night before or morning of?
   - Do they prefer physical printouts or digital?
   - Do they annotate or just read?

4. **Meeting Type Variations:**
   - Do board meetings need different format than client meetings?
   - Are internal meetings briefed differently than external?
   - Do they want different detail levels for different meeting types?

5. **Your EA Style:**
   - What information do you naturally capture?
   - What format is easiest for you to create?
   - How can you make this sustainable?

## Tips for Effective Briefs

**Do:**
- Start with most important information (who, why, what's at stake)
- Include personal context about attendees (builds relationships)
- Highlight decisions that need to be made
- Provide clear talking points or suggested approach
- Note sensitive topics or potential pitfalls
- Keep it scannable with headers and bullets
- Update if new information emerges before meeting

**Don't:**
- Include unnecessary background just to fill space
- Bury the key information deep in the brief
- Make it so long they won't read it
- Forget to check stakeholder intel for relationship context
- Skip the brief for "routine" meetings (those often need prep too)

**When to create briefs:**
- External meetings: Always
- Strategic internal meetings: Usually
- Routine 1:1s: Light brief or agenda review
- Board meetings: Comprehensive briefing book
- When in doubt: Brief it
